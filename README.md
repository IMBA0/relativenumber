Relative Number
==============

Adds VIM's ['Relative number'](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Display_line_numbers#Relative_line_numbers) to Visual Studio for use with VSVim.

This extension adds a line number column to the editor and is a drop in replacement for the built in line numbers column.

* Displays to the left of the built-in line number column or in its position if you have VS line numbers disabled
* Supports all code/text views
* Displays and left aligns the current line number
* Uses the existing Visual Studio line number color scheme
